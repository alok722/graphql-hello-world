# GraphQL Hello World

This is a project used in the [GraphQL by Example](https://www.udemy.com/course/graphql-by-example/?referralCode=7ACEB04674F000BAC061) course.

It shows how to set up a minimal GraphQL server with Apollo Server, and how to call it from a web page using JavaScript and the Fetch API.
